**Jupyternaut**: Hi there! I'm Jupyternaut, your programming assistant.
You can ask me a question using the text box below. You can also use these commands:
* `/ask` — Ask a question about your learned data
* `/clear` — Clear the chat window
* `/generate` — Generate a Jupyter notebook from a text prompt
* `/learn` — Teach Jupyternaut about files on your system
* `/export` — Export chat history to a Markdown file
* `/fix` — Fix an error cell selected in your notebook
* `/help` — Display this help message

You can use the following commands to add context to your questions:
* `@file` — Include selected file's contents

Jupyter AI includes [magic commands](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/index.html#the-ai-and-ai-magic-commands) that you can use in your notebooks.
For more information, see the [documentation](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io).


**pughdr**: Write some code to implement a linked list in Python.



**pughdr**: Explain the downsides and overheads associated with linked lists compared to other data structures.




**pughdr**: What about cache performance?



**pughdr**: As an expert software engineer at a company that suffers from denial of service (DoS) attacks, what risks might you face from using linked lists in production code?



**pughdr**: How would you modify the code to mitigate these risks?



**pughdr**: Modify the following Python code that imlpements a linked list to add support for removing a node from the linked list. @file ./src/linked_list.py



**Jupyternaut**: Sorry, an error occurred. Details below:
